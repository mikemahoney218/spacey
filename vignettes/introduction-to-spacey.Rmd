`spacey` is a package designed to make it trivial to produce beautiful 
[rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/) maps for locations in the United States,
letting you easily obtain and combine USGS and ESRI map data into 2D and 3D 
images. This vignette will walk through the basic utilities
in `spacey` and their expected uses.

First, let's load our package:

```{r setup}
library(spacey)
```

The most comprehensive command in `spacey` is `automap`, which only requires 
two vectors, one for latitude and one for longitude^[This package follows 
[ISO 6709](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_6709) convention of representing 
spatial data in the format (latitude, longitude), as opposed to the somewhat 
popular (longitude, latitude) format.], in order to quickly generate a rayshader
image. In fact, you can use as little as a single coordinate pair:

```r
example_map <- automap(44.121268, -73.903734)
example_map
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(pkgload::package_file("man/figures/README-johns_brook_basic-1.png"))
```

And it isn't much harder to add overlays of satellite imagery:

``` r
example_map$update_values(overlay = "World_Imagery")
example_map
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(pkgload::package_file("man/figures/README-johns_brook_overlay-1.png"))
```

Or turn those into 3D visuals:

``` r
example_map$update_values(method = "3d")
example_map
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(pkgload::package_file("man/figures/README-johns_brook_3d-1.png"))
```

In addition, `automap` supports parallelization with `future` straight out of 
the box to speed up map generation -- just call `future::plan("multisession")` 
(or whatever plan you prefer) before `automap` to run the different rayshading 
processes in parallel, notably speeding up the whole map generation process.

All of the elevation and imagery data pulled by this package comes via the 
[USGS National Map API](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/national-geospatial-program/national-map), 
with the satellite imagery in particular coming via 
[ESRI's MapServer API](https://services.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services). 
If you want to save these off as files (so that you can work on your maps 
without an Internet connection, or archive the data used), use the 
`get_heightmap()` and `get_image_overlay()` functions:

``` r
bounding_box <- get_centroid_bounding_box(c(lat = 44.121268, lng = -73.903734), 
                                          distance = 10)
heightmap <- get_heightmap(bounding_box,
                           save.tif = TRUE,
                           tif.filename = "out.tif")
overlay <- get_image_overlay(bounding_box,
                             save.png = TRUE,
                             png.filename = "out.png")
```

You can then use `load_heightmap` and `load_overlay` functions to load those 
files into your session, and then provide the arrays to the `heightmap` and 
`texture` arguments of `automap`.

```r
saved_map <- automap(heightmap = heightmap,
                     texture = overlay)
```

The `automap` function can be customized in dozens of ways to quickly iterate on
maps, changing the specified overlays, terrain heights, color shading, and more.
To tweak individual values used in calculating your map, use the 
`update_values()` function attached to your map objects to only refresh 
components which will change as a result:

```r
tictoc::tic()
example_map$update_values(overlay = "USA_Topo_Maps")
example_map
tictoc::toc()
#> 8.821 sec elapsed
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("topo.png")
```

If you only want to access the USGS and ESRI APIs, there's no need 
to use the `automap` function at all. Instead, you can use the `get_heightmap` 
and `get_image_overlay` functions to accomplish a similar effect.

The largest difference with these functions (other than their return objects) is
that they expect a _bounding box_ for your map, while `automap` will calculate 
one for you based on the spatial extent of your input data and any value you 
pass to its `distance` argument. The bounding box needs to be a list containing
coordinates for the lower left and upper right corners of your data (as two 
separate list elements) -- you can either provide these yourself, or use one of
the two functions provided by `spacey` to do it for you!

The first of these functions is `get_centroid_bounding_box`, which is what 
`automap` uses to find the bounding box for a single coordinate pair. Just 
provide a named vector with latitude and longitude for the center of your map, 
alongside the distance you want your map to span (from the central location to 
any corner):

```{r}
get_centroid_bounding_box(c(
  "lat" = 44.121268,
  "lng" = -73.903734
),
distance = 10
)
```

If you have more than just a single coordinate pair, you're still able to get a 
bounding box for your data via `get_coord_bounding_box` -- just pass it vectors 
containing your latitude and longitude data:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  lat = c(44.05771, 44.18475),
  lng = c(-73.99212, -73.81515)
)

get_coord_bounding_box(df$lat, df$lng)
```

You can also still take advantage of expanding the map to a certain distance 
from your data's central point by finding the centroid for your dataset -- using
`get_centroid` -- and then passing that as the first argument to 
`get_centroid_bounding_box`:

```{r}
get_centroid(df$lat, df$lng)

get_centroid_bounding_box(get_centroid(df$lat, df$lng), 10)
```

All of these functions also have the option to work with (and return) data in 
radians by setting `coord.unit = "radians"`; the default, however, is decimal 
degrees. Functions which take `distance` arguments also have a `dist.unit` 
argument, which can be used to provide distances in `"km"` (the default), 
`"miles", "m"` (for meters), or `"ft"`. Note that the conversions between these
units are imperfect, so use `km` if precision is needed.

No matter which method you use, that bounding box can then be passed to 
`get_heightmap` to obtain USGS elevation data for your area of interest, or 
`get_image_overlay` to obtain satellite images:

```r
bbox <- get_centroid_bounding_box(c("lat" = 44.121268, 
                                 "lng" = -73.903734), 
                                distance = 10)

heightmap <- get_heightmap(bbox)
```

Both of these functions also provide options to save the downloaded imagery to 
file -- either using `save.tif` in `get_heightmap` or `save.png` in 
`get_image_overlay`. You can then load these images back into an R session using 
the `load_heightmap` or `load_overlay` functions, respectively, which will 
create objects ready to be used for mapping with rayshader. 

My guess is that most people who use `spacey` will eventually move on to 
carefully designing their output maps, since you're able to control things with 
much more granularity using the core `rayshader` functions than you are 
with `spacey`. However, the data import functions and quick 
iteration provided by `spacey` will hopefully help you get started with making 
these beautiful maps, letting you spend less time fighting with data and more 
time communicating your landscape to your audience.

## Miscellania

In addition to these main functions, `spacey` implements basic functions for 
converting radians to degrees (via the function `rad_to_deg`) and back again
(via `deg_to_rad`), which may be of some use. Note that these conversions are 
done simply and will incur some error from floating point arithmetic.

It should be noted that `spacey` really isn't a geospatial processing library, 
and these commands are built to be exactly as accurate as needed by core package
functions. For that reason, you probably shouldn't rely upon `get_centroid` or 
`get_*_bounding_box` for points near extreme latitudes or longitudes, as there
are no adjustments built in to deal with these locations, since the USGS data 
`spacey` is designed to work with doesn't really wrap those.
