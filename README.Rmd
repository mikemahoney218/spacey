The `spacey` package provides three main functions to make it easy to quickly 
build beautiful maps of locations in the United States via the 
`[rayshader](https://github.com/tylermorganwall/rayshader)` package. First off,
it provides an `automap` function to quickly make maps using data from the USGS 
national map:

```{r johns_brook_basic}
library(spacey)
example_map <- automap(44.121268, -73.903734)
example_map
```

As well as letting you incorporate overlay textures from ESRI's MapServer API:

```{r johns_brook_overlay}
example_map$update_values(overlay = "World_Imagery")
```

And optionally even turn these into 3D visualizations:

```{r johns_brook_3d}
example_map$method <- "3d"
example_map
```

All of these can also work with the `future` package to speed up processing, 
letting you iterate on your map designs faster:

```{r}
library(future)
plan("sequential")
tictoc::tic()
example_map <- automap(44.121268, -73.903734)
tictoc::toc()
```

```{r}
plan("multisession")
tictoc::tic()
example_map <- automap(44.121268, -73.903734)
tictoc::toc()
```

And while `automap` tries to make it easy to configure these maps, `spacey` also
lets you save off your heightmaps and overlays directly through the functions 
`get_heightmap` and `get_overlay`, so that you can work directly with 
`rayshader` to make these maps by yourself.

There's a lot more to these three functions, alongside a few basic geospatial 
utilities `spacey` implements to make it easier to make maps from your data. For 
more information, check out the 
[introductory vignette](https://mikemahoney218.github.io/spacey/articles/introduction-to-spacey.html)!
## Installation

If the CRAN version badge above is green, you can install the released version 
of `spacey` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("spacey")
```

You can always get the most up-to-date development version with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mikemahoney218/spacey")
```

## Functions

At the moment, `spacey` consists mainly of the following functions:

* `automap` uses a combination of sensible defaults to produce attractive 
  square map outputs from a single central point location.
* `get_heightmap` retrieves an elevation map from the USGS for a specified 
  boundary box and translates it into an R matrix.
* `get_image_overlay` retrieves a texture from ESRI for a specified boundary 
  box and translates it into a matrix.

It also includes several helper functions, including:

* `get_coord_bounding_box` finds the smallest rectangle required to contain 
  a list of lat/long coordinates.
* `get_centroid_bounding_box` finds the corners of a square with diagonals a set
  distance from a central point, enabling map creation for a single central 
  lat/long combination.
* `get_centroid` finds the central point for matched vectors of latitude and 
  longitude.
* `load_heightmap` can import stored .tif files in order to used saved USGS 
  national map data (or potentially other sources).
* `load_overlay` is an _extremely_ thin wrapper around 
  [png::readPNG](http://www.rforge.net/png/), used to read stored ESRI image 
  overlay files.

## Limitations

At the moment, `spacey` is only able to retrieve data from the USGS National 
Map API, limiting its use to the United States. If you have a good API for 
other regions, open an issue or submit a PR!

Similarly, most geospatial calculations implemented in this package don't deal 
well with areas near the poles or Prime Meridian. Given the spatial constraints 
of the USGS dataset, this isn't a problem for current use cases, but be careful 
extending these functions outside of this package.
