Description: One of the remaining pain points in making
    beautiful maps via packages like 'rayshader' is both obtaining and
    processing spatial data to build from. 'spacey' aims to make it easier
    to obtain and use this data for locations within the United States,
    providing utilities to download 'USGS' and 'ESRI' geospatial data and
    quickly turn it into maps.
